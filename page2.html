	Graduate of computer science and development sites - God willing -.<br>
She holds a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Tabuk.<br>
After graduation I decided to go to the field of web development.<br>
One of my goals is to leave a footprint and influence in the community, so I write my experiences and knowledge on <a href="file:///C:/Users/Ranee/sei/homeworks/hw-w02d01-website/page1.html" target="_blank"> my website.</a><br>
My next ambition is to specialize in web development, so every day I strive to gain new experience and skills for development and success. I am still at the beginning, but I am sure that I will achieve the goals I plan - God willing -.
